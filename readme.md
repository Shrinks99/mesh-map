# Mesh map

This is an experimental test of Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for mapping a network of mesh nodes in a city.  It pulls data from a single JSON file formatted according to the [geoJSON spec](https://geojson.org/)

## Development

You must be running a web server on your machine or else this probably won't work properly.  I personally like [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) but use whatever works for you <3
